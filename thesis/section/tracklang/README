LaTeX code is in tracklang.sty. Generic TeX code is in
tracklang.tex (category code of @ must be 11 on input).

The tracklang package is provided for package developers who want a
simple interface to find out which languages the user has requested
through packages such as babel and polyglossia.  *This package
doesn't provide any translations.*  Its purpose is simply to track
which languages have been requested by the user.
